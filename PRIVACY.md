# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 11/26/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **I** (the developer of Citius Vide) handle your data. I am committed to protecting your privacy.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**I do not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or website content to external servers.**

The extension requires permission to access the web pages you visit (`activeTab` and host permissions) solely for the following purpose:
* **Local Processing:** The extension reads the text content of the current web page to apply "Bionic Reading" formatting (highlighting the initial letters of words). This processing happens entirely locally on your device (client-side).

## 2. User Settings

I use the browser's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`) to save your preferences, such as:
* Whether the extension is enabled or disabled.
* Custom color settings.
* Fixation point strength.

These settings are synced between your own Chrome browsers by Google, but **I do not have access to them**.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.

## 4. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at: theo@the0cp.cc
